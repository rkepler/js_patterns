             }, false);

             Those are all fairly obvious. The MDN has a nice explanation for the third & why this happens:

             It is often desirable to reference the element from which the event handler was fired, such as when
             using a generic handler for a series of similar elements. When attaching a function using addEventListener()
             the value of this is changedâ€”note that the value of this is passed to a function from the caller.

             So, now we know that, we are in a position to figure out why var _this = this; is required in the above code.

             Doing $("myLink").on("click", function() {}) means that when the element is clicked, the function is
             fired. But this function is bound as an event handler, so this is set to the reference to the DOM
             element myLink. The success method you define within the Ajax request is just a regular function,
             and as such when it's invoked, this is set to the global object, as it is when any function that's
             not an event handler or an object method is.

             The above is precisely why you'll see a lot of people doing var _this = this or var that = this or
             similar, to store the current value. It's also seen by many as what the correct value should be, but
             that debate is for another day.

             $("myLink").on("click", function() {
                    console.log(this); //points to myLink (as expected)
                    var _this = this;  //store reference
                    $.ajax({
                        //ajax set up
                        success: function() {
                                console.log(this); //points to the global object. Huh?
                                console.log(_this); //better!
                            }
                         });
                });
             */
        });
    });
